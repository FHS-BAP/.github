Since **1948**, the **[Framingham Heart Study](http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org)** (**FHS**), 
under the direction of the **[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/)** (**NHLBI**), 
formerly known as the National Heart Institute, has been committed to identifying the common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
over a long period of time in three generations of participants. 
Since **1971**, the **[Boston University Aram V. Chobanian & Edward Avedisian School of Medicine](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/)** (**BUMC**) 
has served as NHLBI contractor and academic partner for the study. 
In **2020**, the **[BUMC](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/)** received an infrastructure grant from the **[National Institute on Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/)** (**NIA**) 
to establish the **[FHS Brain Aging Program](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/fhs-bap/)** (**FHS-BAP**).

Since its inception, the **[FHS-BAP Data Core](https://github.com/FHS-BAP)** has played a crucial role in strengthening the data infrastructure 
necessary for studying brain aging, cognitive decline, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), and all causes of dementia. 
Our comprehensive strategy for managing and sharing FHS clinical and longitudinal exposome data for AD-related research encompasses 
a wide range of information. This includes legacy data such as demographic characteristics and common risk factors collected from FHS core exams, 
laboratory biomarkers covering proteomics and genomics data, as well as neuropsychological (NP) assessments, Brain MRI/PET data, and Brain tissue data. 
Meanwhile, we also make great efforts to incorporate new clinical data, including medication records, physical activity assessments, surgical history, 
lifestyle, diet, as well as novel digital markers related to health data. Upholding the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) 
in data management, we ensure the integrity and accessibility of this valuable data. Through close collaboration with 
**[FHS-BAP internal cores](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/fhs-bap/for-researchers/programs-and-cores/)**, 
FHS contract staff, FHS study research collaborators, and external teams worldwide, we facilitate the seamless collection, auditing, 
quality control, processing, and sharing of curated tidy datasets to ensure data accuracy, reliability and research-analysis readiness. 

#### üìä Data Management and Sharing

Our strategy involves managing and sharing a broad spectrum of FHS clinical and longitudinal exposome data pertinent to AD-related research. This encompasses legacy data, such as demographic characteristics and risk factors, collected from FHS core exams, along with laboratory biomarkers covering proteomics and genomics data, neuropsychological assessments, Brain MRI/PET data, and Brain tissue data. Additionally, we diligently incorporate new clinical data, including medication records, physical activity assessments, surgical history, lifestyle, diet, and novel digital markers related to health data.

Embracing the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) in data management, we prioritize the integrity and accessibility of this valuable data. Through close collaboration with internal cores, FHS contract staff, research collaborators, and external teams worldwide, we ensure seamless collection, auditing, quality control, processing, and sharing of curated tidy datasets, promoting data accuracy, reliability, and research-analysis readiness.

#### üíº Support Services and Consultation

Furthermore, the FHS-BAP Data Core offers study design consultations, data analysis training, detailed coding manuals, research protocols, routine team meetings, and weekly online office hours for additional support for data analysts. Panel discussions for specific projects draw expertise from other cores and collaborators. As a cornerstone of the FHS-BAP project, the Data Core facilitates seamless data management and sharing pipelines, both within and beyond the FHS study, underscoring the importance of efficient practices.

#### ‚è© Accelerating Data Sharing

Our efforts in curating, integrating, and sharing data, coupled with consultation for data analysis and interpretation, support diverse research initiatives and collaborations within and beyond the FHS-BAP project. Harmonized curated datasets and standardized cognitive measurements offer significant benefits to researchers, promoting cross-study comparability, robust analyses, and collaborative research efforts.

#### üöÄ Continuous Improvement and Collaboration

The FHS-BAP Data Core accelerates data sharing by enhancing management and documentation processes, ensuring integrity and accessibility. Collaborating with the FHS contract data management team, it coordinates seamless data sharing, solicits feedback from analysts, updates datasets regularly, and provides access to source programs for tailored data analysis via the FHS-BAP Github repository, empowering researchers to meet their specific research needs.

### üéâ Conclusion

Through its comprehensive efforts in data management, sharing, and support services, the FHS-BAP Data Core continues to play a critical role in advancing research in brain aging, cognitive decline, AD, and all causes dementia.
