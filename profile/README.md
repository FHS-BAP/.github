##  ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the FHS-BAP Data Core GitHub Repositories!

We're delighted to have you here. As a central hub for managing and sharing data collected as part of the Framingham Heart Study Brain Aging Program (FHS-BAP), our mission is to advance Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research by ensuring the integrity, accessibility, and usability of valuable research data.

Please explore our [FHS-BAP website](https://fhs-bap.github.io/) to learn more about the comprehensive data we manage, our collaborative efforts to understand the complex links between modifiable risk factors and cognitive decline, and how we support ongoing research projects aimed at enhancing our understanding of AD. Whether you're a researcher, collaborator, or simply interested in learning more about our work, we invite you to engage with us and join our efforts to make meaningful advancements in AD research.

Thank you for visiting, and we look forward to connecting with you!
